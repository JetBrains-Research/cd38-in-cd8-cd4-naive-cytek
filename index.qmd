# General info {.unnumbered}

This documents is a technical all-in-one documents that contains all the details, code and scripts that are required to replicate the analysis.
Input and intermediate data can be obtained for <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn53238646">Synapse</a>.
Files Cytometry_Panel_for_pipeline.csv and Samples_Metadata_for_pipeline.csv should be downloaded to input_data folder.
Folder Unmixed_Samples_FCS with unmixed FCS files should be downloaded to input_data folder. Other folders and files can be generated by scripts or downloaded from Synapse.
Folder Unmixed_Samples_FCS is required for data_preprocessing.qmd step and will produce folders Transformed_Samples_FCS and Transformed_Samples_Downsampled_FCS.
For expression_processing step is required folder Transformed_Samples_Downsampled_FCS and will produce intermediate files in Intermediate_Pipeline_Files folder.
visualization.qmd step creates final figures using intermediate files from Intermediate_Pipeline_Files folder.

If you face error similar to this during expression_processing.qmd step:

```         
Warning in gzfile(file, "wb") :
  cannot open compressed file './cd38-in-cd8-cd4-naive-cytek/.Rproj.user/shared/notebooks/23EAD2A9-expression_processing/1/96DEFFDB4f142241/cdkbhoo15k5mv_t/a6c60ec25e5f474fb1522d9626be1e7a.snapshot', probable reason 'No such file or directory'
Error in gzfile(file, "wb") : cannot open the connection

```

Just ignore it and rerun ggplot function for current chunk.
