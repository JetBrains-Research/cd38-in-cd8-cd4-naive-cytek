## CD38 in CD4 and CD8

Scripts for Spectrum Flow Cytometry processing. 
Project created using <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>, it's installation is recommended before code reproduction. 
Input and intermediate data can be obtained for <a href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn53238646">Synapse</a>.
Files Cytometry_Panel_for_pipeline.csv and Samples_Metadata_for_pipeline.csv should be downloaded to input_data folder.
Folder Unmixed_Samples_FCS with unmixed FCS files should be downloaded to input_data folder. Other folders and files can be generated by scripts or downloaded from Synapse.
Folder Unmixed_Samples_FCS is required for data_preprocessing.qmd step and will produce folders Transformed_Samples_FCS and Transformed_Samples_Downsampled_FCS.
For expression_processing step is required folder Transformed_Samples_Downsampled_FCS and will produce intermediate files in Intermediate_Pipeline_Files folder.
visualization.qmd step creates final figures using intermediate files from Intermediate_Pipeline_Files folder.
