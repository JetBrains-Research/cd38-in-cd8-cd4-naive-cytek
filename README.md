# CD38 in CD4 and CD8

This project is dedicated for reproducing paper (name and link will be added later) results.<br>
Main purpose of pipeline is to process Cytek FCS unmixed files, clear from data debris, doubles and dead cells, and
then divide left cells on types and subtypes for comparing their proportions between age cohorts.

## Requirements

Project created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), it's installation is recommended before code reproduction.<br>
Folder with name "input_data" should be created in project folder and input data should be downloaded to it from Synapse.

## Input and intermediate data

Input and intermediate data can be obtained for [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn53238646). <br>
Files [Cytometry_Panel_for_pipeline.csv](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn53424234) and 
[Samples_Metadata_for_pipeline.csv](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn61406688) should be downloaded to `input_data` folder.<br>
Folder [Unmixed_Samples_FCS](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn53238692) with unmixed FCS files should be downloaded 
to `input_data` folder.<br> 
Other folders and files can be generated by scripts or downloaded from Synapse.<br>
Pipeline goes as follows:
- `data_preprocessing.qmd` takes `Unmixed_Samples_FCS` folder and produce folders `Transformed_Samples_FCS`  and 
  `Transformed_Samples_Downsampled_FCS`
- `expression_processing.qmd` takes `Transformed_Samples_Downsampled_FCS` and produce `Intermediate_Pipeline_Files` folder
- `visualization.qmd` takes `Intermediate_Pipeline_Files` and creates final figures
